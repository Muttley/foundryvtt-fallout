# v11.10.0

## Enhancement
- [#334] Add a setting to consumables to specify the amount of rad damage CD that are rolled when consuming it
- [#348] Improve the way Power Armor is handled on the sheets

	* You can now optionally attach Power Armor items to a base "Armor Frame" item (this can be found in the core compendiums).
	* This is done by editing the frame item and using the Frame tab to select/deselect which power armor items owned by the actor are attached.
	* The frame and any attached items will be grouped together at the top of the inventory section, and each attached piece will show a "plug" icon to show they attached to a base frame.
	* All attached items will also share Power, Equipped and Stashed settings so that using these controls on any item in the group will modify the value on all items.

- [#366] Add tool to simplify the breaking down of Junk items

	* This can be launched from the Gear tab of the character sheet, there is a new item control button next to the Junk inventory item.
	* This tool also checks to see what levels of the Salvage perk you have and handles the salvage process accordingly.
	* GMs can right-click on a salvage results card and select to "Advance Game Time" by the amount detailed on the result chat card.

- [#367] Add option to automatically reduce weapon damage by wear and tear rate and refuse to fire if broken

	* New option called "Apply Wear and Tear to Weapon Damage" added and is enabled by default.  This will automatically reduce the damage of a weapon by the amount of wear and tear, and a weapon will become unusable once the base damage is reduced to zero by wear and tear.

- [#370] Allow posting items to chat even if they're not currently editable (for example, locked compendium items)
- [#371] Reduce interface clutter by only showing the current damage of a weapon
- [#373] Make the favourite weapons list more readable by moving the damage type into the additional data
- [#375] Stashing an item in your inventory should also unequip it
- [#376] Equipping an item in your inventory should also unstash it
- [#377] Provide a built in Macro to open the Scavenging Help web tool

## Bugs
- [#356] Laser Gun Damage Value Incorrect
- [#365] Typo in description of all Grognak the Barbarian magazines
- [#368] 10mm Auto Pistol price and weight wrong
- [#369] Weapon Wear & Tear should be a numeric value

	* The upgrade process will attempt to migrate existing values, but if a non-empty, non-numeric string is found will default to a value of 1

- [#372] Available ammo for a weapon missing from favourite and main weapons list
- [#384] Available shots calculation not updated immediately a new ammo item is added to the character

## Chore
- [#357] Ensure there are no compatibility issues with Foundry V12
- [#358] globalThis.mergeObject must now be accessed via foundry.utils.mergeObject *(Foundry v12 compatibility)*
- [#359] globalThis.duplicate must now be accessed via foundry.utils.duplicate *(Foundry v12 compatibility)*
- [#360] The {{select}} handlebars helper is deprecated *(Foundry v12 compatibility)*
- [#361] globalThis.randomID must now be accessed via foundry.utils.randomID *(Foundry v12 compatibility)*
- [#362] game.system.model.Actor.character.body_parts no longer accessible when checking resistances *(Foundry v12 compatibility)*
- [#363] CONST.CHAT_MESSAGE_TYPES is deprecated in favor of CONST.CHAT_MESSAGE_STYLES *(Foundry v12 compatibility)*
- [#364] The async option for Roll#evaluate has been removed *(Foundry v12 compatibility)*
- [#379] Merge French translation updates from Crowdin
- [#381] ActiveEffect#icon has been migrated to ActiveEffect#img *(Foundry v12 compatibility)*
- [#383] Global "Die" is now namespaced under foundry.dice.terms.Die *(Foundry v12 compatibility)*

	* Each Item section on character now has a new control icon (magnifying glass) which when clicked will open a list of Items from all compendiums, filtered by the specific type for the section.

---

# v11.6.1

## Enhancements

---

# v11.6.0

## Enhancements
- [#244] Add support for Minion NPC type
- [#254] Creature & NPC Poison DR can have locational values
	* The system will attempt to migrate existing Poison DR values, but as it was a free text field and there is no way of knowing the format people have used, it is advisable to check all NPC/Creature NPCs to ensure the Poison DR values are correct.

## Enhancements
- [#141] Add ability to specify Normal, Mighty/Notable, Legendary/Major categories on Creature and NPC sheets

	* The migration script will attempt to work out which category an NPC should be by correlating its level and XP reward.  If that's not possible a warning message will prompt you so you can manually check individual NPC sheets and set the correct category.

- [#142] Auto-calculate XP reward for NPCs

	* This field is now read-only and autocalculated from the Creature or NPC's Level and Category

- [#162] Added Weapons item compendium (68 items)
- [#163] Added Weapon Mods item compendium (145 items)
- [#169] Allow settlement job assignment numbers to be modified by Active Effects

	* The following keys can be used to adjust the number of job assignments in a settlement:
		~~~
		system.assignments.build
		system.assignments.business
		system.assignments.guard
		system.assignments.hunting_and_gathering
		system.assignments.scavenging
		system.assignments.tend_crops
		system.assignments.trade_caravan
		system.assignments.unnasigned
		~~~

- [#171] Add new text enricher to detect `+/-nCD` or `+/-nDC` (where `+/-` is an optional symbol, and `n` is a number) and format the string with the Combat Dice icon

- [#178] Added Robot Modules item compendium (13 items)
- [#186] Create GM interface for triggering party sleep durations.  This can be launched with the new `Party Sleep (GM)` macro provided
- [#188] Automatic condition tracker tied to World time

	* When enabled in the system settings, Character's belonging to players will have their Hunger, Thirst and Sleep values adjusted automatically based on the passing with time in the world. **NOTE:** Your players will *really* have to be on the ball with managing their food & drink resources with this enabled
	* Without any modules installed, only the Party Sleep tool will advance world time
	* If you have the Simple Calendar (or similar) module installed, the GM can adjust world time and have the character's condition statuses update following the core rules (p.190)
	* There are three new system settings that can be used to adjust this behaviour:

		- **Sync Conditions with World Clock**: This enables you to toggle on/off the automatic condition updates
		- **Max Time Jump (hours)**: If the game time changes by more than this amount of hours in one step, then ignore it and set the last Hunger, Thirst and Sleep timestamps to the new time. This ensures that no unexpected spikes in Fatigue are added to characters
		- **Conditions Skip Missing Players**: If this is checked, only characters who's player owner is current online and logged in will have their conditions adjusted

	* **NOTE:** There is currently no automation around any diseases that adjust the condition time steps. This will hopefully be added at a later date

- [#191] Give ability to disable automatic XP calculation for people who wish to homebrew the level break points

## Bugfixes
- [#144] Add conversion Lbs/Kgs for Materials
- [#147] Skill names not localized in skill roll chat messages
- [#165] Show correct weight system on encumbrance bar when system is set to Kg
- [#173] Inline rolls almost unreadable on item chat cards and sheet descriptions

## Chores
- [#174] Tidy up Weapon Quality and Damage Effect data in schema
- [#175] Retire the hovers.json facility as we are allowed to have this information in the i18n files for use in tooltips
	* If you are able, please help out with translating these new tooltips (and other strings) via the [Crowdin Project](https://crowdin.com/project/foundryvtt-fallout).
- [#184] Deprecate the "Mouse Hover JSON file" setting

*Many thanks to Modiphius for allowing the inclusion of player facing item compendiums which contain various classes of item from the core rulebook. Thanks to their generosity the system now comes with compendiums containing 1031 items from the core rulebook.*

## Bugfix
- [#110] Migrations not running correctly

---

# v11.3.0

## Enhancements
- [#13] Add new Settlement Actor and corresponding sheet
- [#37] The following character sheet fields are now auto-calculated and have new variables that can be used to adjust them with Active Effects if needed:

	* **Defense** (adjusted by `system.defense.bonus`)
	* **Max Health** (adjusted by `system.health.bonus`)
	* **Initiative** (adjusted by `system.initiative.bonus`)
	* **Melee Damage** (adjusted by `system.meleeDamage.bonus`)

- [#69] Add ability to consume Consumable items and adjust thirst, hunger, hp, rads, etc. accordingly.

	* This handles HP/Radiation damage healing, Chem addiction rolls, and also adjusts Hunger and Thirst levels appropriately.  Any other effects still need to be handled manually at the moment.

- [#71] Add new Intoxication condition field to help track the amount of alcoholic beverages consumed during a session
- [#75] Add Radiation Healed field to Consumable items, as they are all potentially able to heal Radiation damage
- [#77] Seperate consumable addictive field into a boolean Addictive checkbox and a numeric Addiction Number for clarity
- [#78] Add new Addiction item type, similar to Disease items, and displayed on the Status screen
- [#81] Non-Character weight calculations

	* NPCs and Creatures both now have their inventory weights calculated, and you are now able to set a carry capacity on Creatures

- [#85] Add Macro to start a new game session

	* This is called **"New Session"** and it resets the Party AP to zero, sets the GM AP to the number of players and resets the Intoxication (the number of alcoholic drinks consumed by the player during a session) and Chem Dose counters to zero ready for a new game session

- [#86] Add group field to Consumable items to allow for different items sharing the same addiction name
- [#87] Add flag to show whether food consumable items count as prepared or not
- [#88] Switch Chem consumable's Duration field to a drop-down

	* The migration script for this change will attempt to determine which Duration to use, but this will only work for non-abbreviated English language names that match (in a non-case-sensitive way) the names of these durations somewhere in the string.  Any items whose duration can't be migrated will be given the template default of "instant".

- [#91] Add Thirst Reduction value to Beverage consumables
- [#92] Create new interface for managing the amount of Chem doses a character has taken this session

	* This can be accessed by clicking the "pill" button in the Addictions table list (character sheet Status tab).  If the character already owns an "Addiction" item with the same name as the Chem (or Chem Group for Chems which share the same addiction), then rolls for addiction are no longer made

- [#94] Add new item type for settlement Objects and Structures
- [#99] Lock and add tooltips to sheet fields that are being overridden by active effects

- [#70] Consumable chat card shows irrelevant details
- [#72] Consumable `system.addictive` field should be a numeric
- [#74] Chems are able to heal HP as well, so the field should be available on the item sheet for them
- [#93] Custom skill names not displayed correctly due to i18n translation missing

## Chores
- [#33] Merged Polish language updates from Crowdin
