		"description": "<p>A standard part of the domestic model Mister Handy, the internal boiler was to be used to provide hot tea and coffee in the morning for the robot&rsquo;s owners, as well as a ready source of hot water for food preparation and household cleaning purposes. Post-War, Mister Handy units with a functional boiler are sought-after companions, as thoroughly boiling water is one way to clean it and make it safe to drink. A self-cleaning mechanism keeps it from becoming contaminated between uses, though this does take some time to work</p>",
