Bottlecap mines are constructed from a simple container such as a lunchbox, filled with bottle caps and a crude explosive mixture, and </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">fitted with a sensor and a detonator. The explosive force hurls the caps over a wide area at such speed that they are essentially shrapnel.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Special:</strong>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">when constructing a Bottlecap mine, you may add extra bottlecaps; every 10 caps added increases the damage by +1 @fos[DC]</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">. When the mine detonates, roll the damage rating a second time: the total rolled is the number of intact caps found in the zone where the mine detonated.</span> <br><br></p>",
