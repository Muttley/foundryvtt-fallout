		"description": "<p>A microfusion cell&mdash;or fusion cell&mdash;is a miniaturized fusion reactor used in light energy weapons. They use volatile hydrogen isotopes which undergo fusion when subjected to extreme heat and pressure, and they can explode if exposed to a significant external heat source. Difficult to refuel without the proper facilities, these cells are often simply disposed of when depleted.</p> <p>When fusion cell ammunition is found, it is in the form of a single cell containing the number of shots generated.</p> <p><strong>Quantity Found:</strong> [[/r 14+7dc # Fusion Cell]]</p> <p><em>(by default item is set to average shots result)</em></p>",
