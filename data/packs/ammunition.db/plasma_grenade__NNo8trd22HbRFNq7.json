The blast of a plasma grenade generates vast amounts of heat which more than makes up for the lack of shrapnel or concussive shockwaves.</p>\n<p>Special: Plasma grenades inflict both physical and energy damage. Roll damage as normal, and then reduce the total by whichever of the target&rsquo;s damage resistances is lower out of Physical or Energy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
