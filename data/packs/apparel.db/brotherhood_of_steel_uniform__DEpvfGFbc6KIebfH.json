The bodysuit&rsquo;s surface is covered with an assortment of interface ports and connections to connect the wearer with the Power Armor frame, over it. The Brotherhood of Steel employ these as the base of their standard uniforms, ensuring that as many of their personnel as possible are ready to wear full armor. In battle, the uniform is normally worn under other armor if Power Armor is unavailable, while senior Brotherhood officers often wear a bomber jacket or armored battlecoat over their undersuit.</span> </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
