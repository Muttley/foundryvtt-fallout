The rarity of its manufacture means that it&rsquo;s hard to acquire for anyone not on good terms with the Institute, and expensive even then.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Each piece of Synth armor other than helmets can accept two mods, one of which is a Material, the other of which is an Upgrade. Synth helmets may only accept a Material mod. For mods applied to Torso armor, double the weight and cost (this has already been done for Torso Only mods). All Synth Armor Material mods are&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">installed with the Repair skill</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">.</span> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Synth Amor:</strong> Laminated, Resin, Microcarbon, Nanofilament</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
