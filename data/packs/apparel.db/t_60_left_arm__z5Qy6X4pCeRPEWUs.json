		"description": "<p>Developed shortly after the U.S. Army&rsquo;s victory in Anchorage, the T-60 series of Power Armor was designed as the next generation of armor to replace the T-51. It was in the process of being issued to U.S. Army units serving domestically when the bombs dropped, meaning that large quantities were still in storage awaiting deployment. As a result, stockpiles of the armor have been claimed by the Brotherhood of Steel, and Brotherhood soldiers in T-60 armor has become an iconic feature of their presence in a region.</p>\n<p>Each piece of T-60 Power Armor can accept three mods: an upgrade mod, one plating mod, and a system. All Unique T-60 Power Armor Upgrade Mods are installed with the Repair Skill.</p>\n<p><strong>Unique T-60 Power Armor Upgrade Mods:</strong> T-60b, T-60c, T-60d, T-60e, T-60f</p>",
