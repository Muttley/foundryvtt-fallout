The drink&rsquo;s distinctive blue glow comes from the (safe for human consumption) isotope additive developed by beverageers working with the United States military. Most bottles found were from special pre-release batches sent to chosen retailers or found in trucks in the process of shipping the product. The drink&rsquo;s effects are extremely potent.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You receive 1 cap upon opening and drinking a bottle of Nuka-Cola Quantum.</span> </p>",
