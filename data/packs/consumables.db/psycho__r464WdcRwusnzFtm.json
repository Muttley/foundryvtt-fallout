It&rsquo;s still common in the wasteland, as the post-War plant Hubflower has proven to replicate several of the ingredients of the pre-War version. Psycho stimulates aggression and dulls pain receptors, allowing the user to fight harder with less care for their own safety.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Psycho Addiction:</strong> A failed addiction roll renders you addicted to Psycho.
