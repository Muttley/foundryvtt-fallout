Most robots have internal self-diagnostic and repair protocols, which are activated when the robot performs repairs or is repaired by someone else. A robot repair kit helps jump-start and accelerate these protocols.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use:</strong> A robot repair kit can be used in one of two ways: it can be applied using the Take Chem minor action, healing 4 HP or treating an Injury immediately, or it can be applied as part of a First Aid action, healing 4 HP or treating an Injury in addition to any other healing done. As with any repairs to a robot or Power Armor, this is done using the Repair skill rather than the Medicine skill, but the actions used are otherwise the same.</li>\n</ul>",
