Development was never finished, but prototype versions were distributed through the black market and by scavengers after the War. It enhances all aspects of a user&rsquo;s abilities for a few minutes, but it is extremely addictive, and the withdrawal symptoms are as far-reaching as the effects.</p>\n<p><strong>X-Cell Addiction:</strong> A failed addiction roll renders you addicted to X-Cell. You increase the difficulty of all tests by +1 whenever you are not under the effects of X-Cell.</p>",
