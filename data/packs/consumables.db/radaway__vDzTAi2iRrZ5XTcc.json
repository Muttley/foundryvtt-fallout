		"description": "<p>An intravenous drug which purges radiation from the user&rsquo;s body, absorbing radiation as it circulates through the user&rsquo;s bloodstream. It&rsquo;s also a potent diuretic, expelling the radiation with the user&rsquo;s urine, so it&rsquo;s advisable to drink a lot of (clean) water shortly after taking a dose. Sometimes encountered in a diluted form, reducing its effectiveness as the user is only taking a partial dose. Diluted RadAway is only about half as effective, but it&rsquo;s easier to find.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use:</strong> RadAway can be used in one of two ways: it can be applied using the Take Chem minor action, healing 4 Radiation damage immediately, or it can be applied as part of a First Aid action, healing 4 Radiation damage in addition to any other healing done (remove Radiation damage before applying other healing effects). Diluted RadAway works in the same way, but only heals 2 Radiation damage.</li>\n</ul>",
