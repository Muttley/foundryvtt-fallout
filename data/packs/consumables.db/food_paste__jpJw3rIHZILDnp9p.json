Developed by Vault-Tec in conjunction with the Federal Government, this supplied participating schools with a supply of food paste, fortified with vitamins, minerals and all the nutrients a growing body needs, and which would remain unspoiled for over a century.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The paste is a flavorless mush, garish pink in color, and may have unknown long-term effects on psychology or physiology. It does, however, make the body healthier after consumption.</span> </p>",
