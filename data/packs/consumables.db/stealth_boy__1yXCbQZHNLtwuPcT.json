		"description": "<p>One of the most interesting technologies developed before the War, the Stealth Boy 3001 is a compact device which generates a modulating refraction field which transmits light from one side of the field to the other. The result is near-perfect active camouflage, ranging from a sort of distorted transparency when moving to almost total invisibility when stationary.</p>\n<p>The Stealth Boy was reverse engineered from captured Chinese Stealth Armor during the War, and while the technology was never perfected&mdash;even the most advanced Stealth Boy consumes its battery in around 30 seconds&mdash;it was still seen to be reliable enough for service.</p>\n<p>Long-term use of Stealth Boy technology has been observed to cause permanent neurological changes, resulting in paranoid delusions, hallucinations, and other mental changes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use:</strong> A Stealth Boy is activated using the Interact minor action. Once active, the device functions for three full turns: your current turn, your next turn, and your turn after that, after which, it ceases to function and is junk. When activated, a Stealth Boy renders you and the equipment you are carrying nearly invisible. Enemies add +2 to the difficulty of all tests to spot you; they may still hear you or notice your presence in other ways if they&rsquo;re looking hard enough. In addition, even if you have been detected, the invisibility increases your Defense by +2.</li>\n</ul>",
