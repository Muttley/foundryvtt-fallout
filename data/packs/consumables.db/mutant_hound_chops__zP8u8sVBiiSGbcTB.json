For reasons unknown, once cooked, the meat helps absorb radiation already in the body, lessening the effects of radiation poisoning. This effect doesn&rsquo;t compare to proper anti-radiation meds like RadAway, but it can be useful to have a few on hand to soak up the radiation you picked up during an excursion.</span> </p>",
