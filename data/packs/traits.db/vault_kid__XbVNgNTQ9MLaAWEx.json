In addition, your carefully-planned upbringing means you have one additional tag skill of your choice.</p>\n<p>You may also work with the Gamemaster to determine what sort of experiment took place within your Vault. Once per quest, the GM may introduce a complication which reflects the nature of the experiment you unwittingly took part in, or introduce a complication related to your early life of isolation and confinement within the Vault. If the GM does this, you immediately regain one Luck Point.</p>",
