Used both before and after the War for entertainment purposes and emergency messaging alike, a radio is still only as good as the signal it receives. Most regions of the wastelands have a few radio stations active, playing old music for anyone with a working receiver, and a variety of groups make use of the remaining radio towers to broadcast signals to their members over long distances, but the range of these signals is still fairly limited.</p>",
