The dog has the profile shown to the side and is treated as an allied NPC creature under your command (see p.338). If you need to forage for food and water, your dog looks after themselves. If your dog is slain, then you either find a new dog before the next adventure, or you may trade this perk for a different one after this adventure.</p>",
