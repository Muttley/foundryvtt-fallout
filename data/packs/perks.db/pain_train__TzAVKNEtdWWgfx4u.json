When you take this action, you move into reach of an enemy within Medium range (1 zone) and make a STR + Athletics test with a difficulty of 2. If you succeed, the enemy suffers damage equal to your normal unarmed damage, and is knocked prone.</p>\n<p>At rank 2, you add +1DCD and the Stun damage effect to the damage inflicted. At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, especially large or sturdy creatures cannot be knocked prone by this action. Each time you take this perk, the level requirement increases by 5.</p>",
