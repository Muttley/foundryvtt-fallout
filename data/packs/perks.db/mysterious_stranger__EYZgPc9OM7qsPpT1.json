		"description": "<p>From time to time, a Mysterious Stranger comes to your aid, with lethal results. At the start of a combat encounter, you may spend 1 Luck point. If you do so, then at any point during the scene, the GM may have the Mysterious Stranger appear, make a single ranged attack against an enemy you attacked, or who just attacked you, and then vanish. If you spend a Luck point and the Mysterious Stranger does not appear, the GM must refund the Luck point you spent.</p>\n<p>The stranger has an AGI of 10, a Small Guns skill of 6, and counts Small Guns as a Tag skill. They always roll 3d20 for attacks, rather than 2d20, and their attack&mdash;using a custom .44 Magnum revolver&mdash;inflicts 8CD Piercing 1, Vicious physical damage. They always appear within their weapon&rsquo;s ideal range. Any attempt to find where the Stranger went after their attack fails.</p>",
